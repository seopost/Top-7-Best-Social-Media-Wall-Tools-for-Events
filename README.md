You‚Äôve probably been to an event where the big screen wasn‚Äôt just showing slides or logos‚Ä¶ it was showing you. That‚Äôs a [social media wall](https://socialwalls.com/) ‚Äî a live feed of posts, photos, and videos from your guests. And trust me, once people see their face or their post up there, they keep posting.

It‚Äôs not just a cool tech gimmick ‚Äî it‚Äôs a real way to make your audience feel part of the event, to create buzz, and to collect content you can use later.

But with so many tools out there, picking the right one can be a headache. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve done the digging for you. Here are 7 social media wall tools that actually work and make your event look like it‚Äôs been planned by a pro.
